## Quickly check a car's reliability
A simple extension that automates searches I commonly used to check if a car was worth buying.

Current searches:

` How many miles will a XXX last? `

` CarComplaints.com XXX `

## To Install

Download the file and then add it to your browser's extensions.
You must have Developer Mode enabled on your browser. Please see [this stack echange answer](https://superuser.com/questions/247651/how-does-one-install-an-extension-for-chrome-browser-from-the-local-file-system) for a guide on how to load an upacked extension. 
Alternatively [Look up "how to install unpacked extension"](https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20install%20unpacked%20extension) for your favorite browser.

## To Use

Select a car's name, preferably with the year included, then right-click and click "Check Reliability of XXX"

This will query Bing with the above searches and open 2 tabs with the results.
